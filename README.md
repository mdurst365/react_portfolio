# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.

## Requirements

- [ ] Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects
- [x] Use React
- [x] A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
- [x] A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
- [x] Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
- [x] A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
- [ ] Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

- [x] Your name
- [x] Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
- [x] A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects
- [x] A list of projects
- [x] For each project, make sure you have the following: Project title, Link to the deployed version, Link to the GitHub repository, GIF or screenshot of the deployed application (screenshots are in the repos - icons used to make portfolio look cohesive)

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

- [X] A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
- [X] A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
- [X] Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
- [X] A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* **Important**: If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read the [GitHub note on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) and the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.
