# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

This was a homework assignment created for the OSU Coding Bootcamp. It uses React components to remake a previously built multi-page web application into a single page one.

## Requirements

- [x] Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects
- [x] Use React
- [x] A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
- [x] A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
- [x] Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
- [x] A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
- [x] Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

- [x] Your name
- [x] Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
- [x] A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects
- [x] A list of projects
- [x] For each project, make sure you have the following: Project title, Link to the deployed version, Link to the GitHub repository, GIF or screenshot of the deployed application (screenshots are in the repos - icons used to make portfolio look cohesive)

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

- [X] A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
- [X] A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
- [X] Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
- [X] A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* **Important**: If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read the [GitHub note on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) and the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.
